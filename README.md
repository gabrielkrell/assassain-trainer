# assassain-trainer
Program to send emails to people for a game of assassin.  Allows the user to enter a list of recipients (names and email addresses) and a time and date for the event to start.  Each participant in the game will be emailed their first target and the relevant info for the event in a customizable message.  This is a Netbeans project rather lazily mirrored here.  The program may be run in either command-line or GUI mode; currently, the GUI mode is more polished.

Currently supports only Gmail accounts (to be sent *from*; you can of course send a message *to* any email provider).  Sorry!
